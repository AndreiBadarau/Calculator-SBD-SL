The SBD & SL Calculator is an Android app designed to assist powerlifters and street lifting enthusiasts in tracking and analyzing their strength metrics. It provides dedicated sections for Squat, Bench Press, and Deadlift (SBD), alongside common Street Lifting movements like Pull-ups, Dips, and Muscle-ups. Users can input variables such as weight lifted and repetitions to calculate estimated one-rep maxes (1RM) or other relevant performance indicators. The app utilizes Android Jetpack's Navigation Component for a smooth user experience within a Material Design dark theme.
